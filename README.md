The portfolio application is designed with a clean, minimalistic, mobile-first approach to emphasize content and ease of navigation. The following design principles were implemented:

Minimalism: Utilizing ample white space and clean typography to ensure readability and focus on content.

Consistency: Maintaining consistent styling across pages and components for a cohesive user experience.

Visual Hierarchy: Establishing a clear hierarchy of information with headings, subheadings, and fixed navigation to guide users through sections.

Accessibility: Ensuring all content is accessible, with proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML tags for screen readers.
